The player is part of an expedition group sent to investigate a remote mountain region where people have reported sightings of 
strange creatures such as ice golems and skeletons. During the expedition, the player falls down a cliff during a storm and is 
separated from the rest of the group.

The game begins with the player waking up in the snow, disoriented and injured, struggling to remember what happened. As the player 
regains control, they begin searching the surrounding area and collecting their scattered equipment, which has fallen across nearby 
ledges and paths.

After recovering their belongings, the player sets out to find the rest of the expedition and regroup. Along the way, the player 
encounters a few injured teammates who are on the brink of death. They explain that the group was attacked by strange ice creatures 
and scattered while trying to escape. One dying member hands the player an ice axe for protection before passing away. Moments later, 
an ice golem approaches, forcing the player into their first major fight.

After defeating the creature, the player continues deeper into the mountains. Along the journey, they collect supplies and discover 
notes, broken equipment, and environmental clues that hint at where the remaining members of the expedition may have gone. The player 
faces hostile wildlife such as wolves, more ice golems, and possibly a powerful boss guarding a critical path forward.

Eventually, the harsh mountains give way to a mysterious and unsettling forest. Upon entering, the player is confronted with a horrifying 
sight: the bodies of their fallen teammates hanging upside down from trees, while crows feast on their remains. This forest is under the 
control of skeletal enemies, and the atmosphere feels unnatural and hostile. As the player fights through skeletons and camouflaging 
mushrooms, they uncover more clues about the fate of the expedition and the true nature of this land.

At the end of the forest stands a massive portal, guarded by a giant skeleton fused with the environment itself. To activate the portal 
and progress, the player must defeat this powerful guardian.

After defeating the giant skeleton, the player enters the portal and is transported to an abandoned urban area known as Place X(to be named later). 
The presence of buildings and asphalt suggests that this area was once inhabited and far more advanced than expected.

The player realizes that Place X may hold the answers behind the strange creatures and events in the mountains. While exploring, the player 
discovers a hidden underground area where several surviving members of the expedition are imprisoned in cells. After freeing them, they 
reveal the truth: Place X is home to an isolated tribe that avoids all contact with the outside world. The ice golems, skeletons, and other 
creatures were created by this tribe as defenses to protect their land from intruders.
The survivors also reveal a shocking betrayal. One member of the expedition, xyz (name to be decided), was a traitor who deliberately led 
the group into the mountains. His true goal was to offer the expedition as part of a ritual performed by the people of Place X. The 
sacrifices are made to a massive magical sphere hidden deep within the settlement. This sphere captures the souls of those sacrificed and, 
in return, grants immortality to the people of Place X. It is later revealed that xyz is the son of the tribe’s chief.

After escaping from their cells, the player and the remaining survivors attempt to find a way back to the outside world. However, their 
escape does not go unnoticed. The tribe’s soldiers quickly realize that the captives have fled and begin hunting them through the abandoned 
structures.

As the player fights through these soldiers in search of an exit, they are eventually confronted by the tribe’s head commander. Overpowered, 
the player is defeated, captured, and brought before xyz.

In the final act, the player breaks free and fights through the tribe’s remaining forces to confront xyz one last time. After defeating him,
the player and the surviving members of the expedition escape Place X through a portal, finally returning to the outside world—forever 
changed by the horrors they witnessed.
